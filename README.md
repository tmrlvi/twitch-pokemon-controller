Twitch Plays Pokemon Controller
===============================

*because random is not random enough*

Welcome to the TPP Controller. The controller is implemented in java and
is compiled to an .exe file (or wrapped to .sh file, if you are a linux user).

The program is quite simple - it has commands queue which deciede what commands
will be sent and the order of them, and an IRC client to connect to the game.

In order to connect with the IRC client, you must have a Twitch user and
get an oauth token from http://twitchapps.com/tmi/. (The oauth can be only used
to access the chat)

The exe compiled with JSmooth - http://jsmooth.sourceforge.net/
